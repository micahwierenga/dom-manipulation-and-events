#DOM Manipulation & Events

## Why is this important?
<!-- framing the "why" in big-picture/real world examples -->
*This workshop is important because:*

Using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM will enable you to write dynamic web applications that can update themselves & be affected by user input in any way you dream up!

## What are the objectives?
<!-- specific/measurable goal for students to achieve -->
*After this workshop, developers will be able to:*

* Select & modify DOM elements
* Create & append DOM elements
* Style CSS with Javascript
* Set event listeners


## Where should we be now?
<!-- call out the skills that are prerequisites -->
*Before this workshop, developers should already be able to:*

- Use chrome developer tools to interact with the DOM
- Create javascript objects and functions
- Be resourceful Googlers

##Select & Modify: Str8-up H4cked
*This workshop will be guided, but self-driven.*

The consultant will introduce each mission, allow time for developers to work on it, and then give a suggested solution before moving on.

*Note:* A [reference guide](#web-api-reference) to the aspects of the Web API is at the bottom of the workshop.

####Mission A

Time to be an [Egor Homakov](http://techli.com/2012/03/how-a-russian-developer-hijacked-github-to-help-the-rails-community/) and get some publicity. 

Head to the Angel List's [job board](https://angel.co/developer/jobs) page to get started. Select each company name and change them all to `WDI Rulez: str8-up h4cked`.

**Hint:**

* How can we identify all the startup elements? Do they share any HTML attributes?

* Once we've identified an attribute they all share, how can we select them all?
	* Tip: try [`document.querySelectorAll(...)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll) to grab everything that matches a query. Note this is different to `.querySelector` which just selects the first item it finds.

* Now that we have a collection, how do we change the text off all of them at once?
	* Tip: iterate through the collection and reset the `textContent` of each.

##Create & Append: Angels Everywhere

####Mission B

Let add the AngelList V to the email list subscribe box. After all, it's good to reward people who sign up for your email.

---

**Hint:**

* Grab the email list box

* Create a span element in the console with the classes `.fontello-angellist`

* Add an ID for good measure (it could help us select it again later)
	* Tip: try `setAttribute`

* Append it to the DOM

##Styling with Javascript: Big Kitty

####Mission C

Our angel V is not big or bold enough! Let's increase its size and give it a fun color.

---

**Hint:**

`.style`


##Set Event Listeners

####Mission D

Register an event which fires when our angel V is clicked that creates an alert message saying "Fund Me!"

---

**Hint:**

`.addEventListener`


##Bonus Mission

####Mission E

When the angel V is hovered-over, change its color to red.

##Closing Thoughts

Knowledge of the Web API allows us to affect and add dynamic behavior to HTML pages.

<h2 id="web-api-reference">Reference Guide</h2>
**General Concepts**

* `for` loop

**Document API**

* `.querySelector`
* `.querySelectorAll`
* `.createElement`

**Element API**

* `.appendChild`
* `.textContent`
* `.setAttribute`
* `.style` (`.<someCSSProperty>`)
* `.addEventListener`

####More worth knowing

**Element API**

* `.removeChild`
* `.parentNode`
* `.children`
* `.getAttribute`
* `.removeEventListener`
